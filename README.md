# Depth-First Search ( DFS ) - Recursive and Iterative Implementation

DFS is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm used to explore all vertices and edges of a graph. The goal of DFS is to start from a given source node and explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

In this repository, DFS is implemented in both **recursive** and **iterative** approaches to demonstrate two different methods of solving the same problem. The graph has been represented using an adjacency list.
